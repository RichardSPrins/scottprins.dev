          Running a business is hard, and for business owners, having an online
          presence just adds to the stack of responsibilities that ultimately
          falls on your shoulders. As a developer, I'm here to help lift some of
          that burden off of your shoulders and get you on track to succeed in
          the ways you need to.

          I try to be selective of which businesses I do work for, as I like to
          work on creative projects and help businesses that have goals that
          align with building a better world for those around them, and the
          customers they serve.

              Working with businesses is a little different than working with
              individuals. We will start by sitting down and deciding what
              direction you would like to take with the design and work from
              there. The website for your business should be an extension of
              what your business represents and I will always take the time to
              get this right.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="w-full mb-4 border border-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4 flex items-start">

              <RiNumber2 className="text-white text-2xl" />
            </div>
            <p>
              In this phase I will create a mockup of the page based on your
              consultation. Before anything is coded, we will go over the design
              and you can decide if you would like to make any changes. If your
              business has used a graphic designer for brand cohesiveness, I am
              very open to working with them to make sure I get everything just
              right.

              In the past year, eCommerce has absolutely exploded in popularity
              and I'm right there to help you out with whatever you might need.
              As of right now, I am offering development on both the Shopify and
              Webflow platforms. Shopify builds are fairly easy unless you want
              something a little more custom, then I would recommend Webflow.

              Most businesses like to be able to advertise any promotions they
              may have going on and I make that easy for you. Whether it's a
              separate page or a section on the main page, I can create
              something that is very easy to update when you have a new
              promotion or sale going on.

              Food delivery has blown up the past year and it can be fully
              implemented to work dynamically with whatever menu you have on
              your page. If this is something your business needs, I can build
              something that works with all the popular food delivery businesses
              or use Square for built-in integration if you provide your own
              pickup/delivery service.

              I do offer social media marketing packages for businesses if that
              is something you would be interested in. I create content that
              generates traffic towards your website and handle any ad campaigns
              on social media to bring in more business. For small businesses
              with a smaller budget, I have no problem going over how to start
              generating a following on social media.

              When I hand over the site, I'll go over how you can post your own
              content and make small adjustments to the page. Any big changes,
              you'll probably want to ask me about prior to making them. Don't
              stress about about it too much, If something breaks on your site
              I'll always be available to fix it.
